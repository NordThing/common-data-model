## About

The Common Data Model of the FAIR4Health Project is implemented as [HL7 FHIR profiles](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html). This project includes the following in 2 main directories:
 * The [FHIR Implementation Guide](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/implementationguide.html) containing the FHIR profiles developed to reflect the common data model of the [FAIR4Health Project](https://www.fair4health.eu/).
 * Configuration files for the [onFHIR Repository](https://onfhir.io/) so that onFHIR starts up with the FAIR4Health profiles.
