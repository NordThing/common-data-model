### Scope

Specify HL7 FHIR logical models and profiles to be used within the
European project [FAIR4Health](https://www.fair4health.eu/).

### Introduction

The overall goal of FAIR4Health is to **facilitate and encourage the EU
health research community to FAIRify, share and reuse** their datasets
derived from publicly funded research initiatives.

This goal is quantified by the following objectives:

1.  To design and implement an effective outreach strategy at EU level
    based on trust building and shared benefit

2.  To produce a set of guidelines to inform a number of Research Data
    Alliance recommendations in order to set the foundations for a FAIR
    data certification roadmap to guarantee high quality of data

3.  To develop and validate intuitive, user-centered technological tools
    to enable the translation from raw (meta)data to FAIR (meta)data and
    support the FAIRification workflow, i.e., the FAIR4Health Platform
    and Agents

4.  To demonstrate the potential impact in terms of health outcomes and
    health research that the implementation of such FAIR data strategy
    will have through the development and validation of 2 pathfinder
    case studies.

***Note:** [FAIR4Health](https://www.fair4health.eu/) project has
received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and
innovation programme under grant agreement No 824666*
